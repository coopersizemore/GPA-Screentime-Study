To use directory and one_student python files you must create a .env file with the following contents

USER=\<NCSU Email Address\>

PASSWORD=\<UnityID Password\>

For One Student, change the first and last name of student to get info for that student
For Sample_Builder, the output is in the .gitignore to avoid publicizing our student email list
